# Predictive Maintenance Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predictive maintenance. It demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression and Decision Trees to predict potential failures in manufacturing processes. The aim is to enable proactive maintenance strategies, improving efficiency and reducing downtime.

## Data Preprocessing
Before applying machine learning algorithms, data must be preprocessed. This includes cleaning, normalization, feature extraction, and selection. Follow the steps outlined in the code to prepare your dataset for modeling.

## Model Training and Evaluation
This project involves training two types of models:
1. **Logistic Regression**: A straightforward yet powerful linear model for classification tasks.
2. **Decision Tree**: A more complex model that can capture non-linear relationships.

Use the provided code snippets to train these models and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Model Saving
Once the models are trained and evaluated, they can be saved for later use or deployment. This is achieved using the `joblib` library, which efficiently serializes Python objects. Follow the instructions in the code to save your models.

## Inference
The project includes an inference function that you can use to make predictions on new data. This function demonstrates how to preprocess new data and apply the trained model to generate predictions.

## SHAP Analysis
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of machine learning models. It helps in understanding how each feature contributes to the prediction. The repository includes a SHAP analysis for the Decision Tree model, providing insights into the decision-making process of the model.

## Conclusion
This project showcases how Logistic Regression and Decision Trees can be applied to solve a predictive maintenance problem. By predicting potential failures in manufacturing processes, these models help in adopting proactive maintenance strategies, thereby enhancing efficiency and reducing operational costs.
